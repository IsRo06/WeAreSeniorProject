Notes from development:

Isa
- The manifest.json file describes what the extension can do and also holds its configurations
- In the manifest.json there's a section titled "Action" the default_popup is the html page that the extension will open
- To test:
    - Go to chrome://extensions
    - Enable developer mode (Switch is in the top right)
    - Choose the Load unpacked option
    - Look for the  folder where the manifest.json file is in the file explorer(idk the apple version of file explorer sorry kath and david)
    - The extension should show up in the list of extensions and it should act like any other extension :D Yipee
- If you make any changes to the code you can just click the refresh button in the extensions card and it'll reflect

Summer
-
Oscar
-Added readme
David
- Added the permission in the manifest file since we will use storage later to save assignments
- host permissions: we need canvas domain
- content_scripts: injected into Canvas pages to parse everything
- content.js was updated to detect Canvas Page and parse the visible To Do Items in the right sidebar
    - To test and see the console log output hover on the three dots on the top right of chrome
        - Go to "More Tools" > "Developer Tools" -> should see a console at the bottom displayong some texts & array
Kath
