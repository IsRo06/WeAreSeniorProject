Notes from development:

Isa
- The manifest.json file describes what the extension can do and also holds its configurations
- In the manifest.json there's a section titled "Action" the default_popup is the html page that the extension will open
- To test:
    - Go to chrome://extensions
    - Enable developer mode (Switch is in the top right)
    - Choose the Load unpacked option
    - Look for the  folder where the manifest.json file is in the file explorer(idk the apple version of file explorer sorry kath and david)
    - The extension should show up in the list of extensions and it should act like any other extension :D Yipee
- If you make any changes to the code you can just click the refresh button in the extensions card and it'll reflect

Summer
- To run tests, do `npm test` from the main directory (that's it :D)
