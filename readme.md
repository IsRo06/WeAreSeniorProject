# CANVAS PETS

This repository contains the code for our canvas extension known as "Canvas Pets". This extension allows users to add interactive and animated pets to their canvas workspace, enhancing the user experience with fun and engaging elements. The aim of our project is to provide students with an engaging way of completing their assignments through the gamification of an otherwise monotone e-learning environment. We believe this extension will help students complete their assignments and stay motivated while doing so.

# Notes

The manifest.json file describes the extension's properties and permissions. The popup.html and popup.js files define the content and behavior of the extension's popup window. Further development is needed to implement the full functionality of adding interactive pets to the canvas workspace
